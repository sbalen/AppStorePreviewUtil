Small routine to cut actual screencaptures in their native form to whatever Apple thinks is the right form, based on FFMPEG operations I found on various StackOverflow posts.

This is solely for my own use, not particulary well structured (please don't judge, haha), or foolproofed in anyway.

However, you are free to take what you want. 

Basically you run it in a new folder with 4 files containing screen captures made with the XCode simulator: ipad6th.mp4, ipad2nd.mp4, 8plus.mp4, 11promax.mp4 and it will produce new files (trailed with _final) that the appstore does seem accept (as 6.5 inch, 5.5 inch and iPad previews)
